                         Installation of TFpredict
                         -------------------------

1) Local installation of BLAST
   
   Follow the instructions at the BLAST home-page for your operating system.
   For Unix, go to http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK52640/
   For Windows, see the instructions http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK52637/
   
   Having BLAST successfully installed, it is necessary to pass the path to
   the executable to TFpredict. To this end, define the environment variable
   
   BLAST_DIR
   
   on your system to point to the installation directory of your copy of BLAST.
   This might be, for instance,
   
   /usr/local/ncbi/blast/                          if you are working on Mac OS,
   /opt/blast/latest/                              if you are using Linux, or
   C:\program~\NCBI\blast-x.x.xxx\                 in case of MS Windows
   
   Note that x.x.xxx stands for some arbitrary version number of BLAST and must
   be replaced as necessary.

   So, the variable BLAST_DIR could be set to one of the above example folders.
   In the bash under MacOS you would, e.g., type
   
   export BLAST_DIR=/usr/local/ncbi/blast/
   
   before executing TFpredict.
