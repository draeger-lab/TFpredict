Welcome to the TFpredict documentation!
========================================

TFpredict is a tool for the identification and structural characterization of transcription factors based on supervised machine learning.

Features
--------

- Distinguish transcription factors (TF) from other proteins (Non-TF)
- Predict the structural superclass of TFs (see TransFac classification)
- Identify the DNA-binding domains of TFs


Citing TFpredict
